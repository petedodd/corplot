\usage{
corplot(X, main = "", labels = NULL, file = "", weights = 1, points = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix whose columns refer to parameters and whose rows to samples}

\item{main}{the plot title (if desired)}

\item{labels}{a character vector of length \code{ncol(X)} to label parameters}

\item{file}{a filename to save pdf output plot to (else plotted to default to device)}

None

\description{
A hexbinned pairs and density plot to examine correlations.
}
\details{
The diagonal panels are histograms of each parameter representing estimates of marginal density. The lower half shows hexbinned plots of correlations between parameters (estimates of pairwise joint densities) together with a loess smoother to indicate trend. If \code{points=TRUE} the pair plots are not hexbinned and points are plotted with alpha proportional to weight.

corplot(matrix(rnorm(3e4),ncol=3),labels=c('x','y','z'),main='3D isotropic Gaussian')
